To go on, Savander even pointed out that instead of trying to make phone screens go bigger and bigger, companies should instead be focusing on creating some new technologies. The article noted that a lot of people might say that having smartphones packed with huge displays for pictures, games, videos, or other forms of media are quite awesome.

Although this is true, on the other hand, larger devices could possibly take quite a toll on the device's overall portability and also make it a little less usable with just a single hand. As of the moment, the Nokia Lumia 900 reportedly has the biggest display on any of the Nokia smartphones having a measurement of 4.3 inches in diagonal. This is in comparison to certain companies that are pushing the total boundaries much further with screens reaching 4.7 inches and more.

The article then notes that at the end of the day, it is still hard to agree that having certain smartphones with much bigger displays are "stupid." Instead, it is still really a matter of personal preference. A number of people prioritize the rich multimedia experience and this is something that those devices with bigger screens can deliver. 

Smaller phones, on the other hand, make the device much more portable. However, devices that are too small could become quite complicated to use and thus quite inconvenient to get. Smaller devices could also hold less features in comparison to bigger phones or devices where things can fit perfectly on the screen without having to be too small for the user to read. For older audiences and users, having a bigger device could be more beneficial as well.
